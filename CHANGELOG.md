# Changelog

These are identical to those found [on GitHub](https://github.com/fins-mods/REnhanced_Extras/releases).
If you want notifications you can open that page then: Click the arrow next to "Watch" at the top → Custom → Releases → Apply, and you'll get GitHub notifications (configurable to be push and/or email) whenever the modpack updates.
